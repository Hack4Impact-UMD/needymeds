  "Heading": "Drug Discount Card FAQs",
  "Accordion1": "Discount drug cards offer discounts on prescription medications. They are not a form of insurance. Some are free while others may involve registration and/or a fee. They are offered by state governments, drug companies, non-profit and for-profit businesses. The NeedyMeds Drug Discount Card, which is free, also covers certain over-the-counter medicines and medical supplies that are written on a valid prescription.",
  "Accordion2": "Carefully evaluate any and all costs involved, such as handling or shipping fees. The fee may add up to more than the discount. When using a free card, it is still important to consider the cost of your medicine - you should always do comparative shopping. Speak with a representative of the plan about concerns and to check if your medicine is included. If you have several plans or cards, your local pharmacist will usually tell you the least expensive way to get your medicine.",
  "Accordion3": "Yes, many larger chains offer medicine discounts to their customers. Many offer some generic prescriptions for $4-$10. Visit NeedyMeds' $4 Generic Discount Drug Programs to find a pharmacy's generic drug program. These programs do not usually include all generics. Again, the pharmacist should be able to help you pick the least expensive way to buy your medicine.",
  "Accordion4": "While some cards are free, others have annual fees that range from $12 to as high as $100. Some companies that advertise free medicine have a \"processing fee\" for each prescription.",
  "Accordion5": "The discounts offered vary widely from 0-80% depending on the program, the drugstore and the prescription medicine being purchased. ",
  "Accordion6": "You may pay more for some brand name medicine, even with a discount, than you would pay for the generic version or you may find the medicine for a lower cost at a different pharmacy.",
  "Accordion7": "Not necessarily. This is a consideration if you are paying a fee. Contact the program to see what medicine is available before making a payment. ",
  "Accordion8": "Not necessarily. This is a consideration if you are paying a fee. Contact the program to see what medicine is available before making a payment. Ask the following questions about the discount card: 1. Is there a contact or customer service number that I can call in case of problems? 2. What is the refund policy on fees? 3. If I am being asked to send money, am I certain my medicine is available at a discount? 4. Is the medicine I need available at no or low-cost through a patient assistance program? (Usually, this would be the better option. Click on Patient Assistance Programs.) 5. Are my drugs provided through a mail-order or a walk-in pharmacy? If it's a walk-in, is there one close to me? If it is a mail-order pharmacy, are there additional handling and shipping costs? ",
  "Card": "Visit the NeedyMeds website for more information.",
  "AccordionHeader1": "Check for savings programs. ",
  "AccordionHeader2": "Shop around — pharmacy prices can vary!",
  "AccordionHeader3": "Ask your doctor if a generic is available.",
  "AccordionHeader4": "Ask about alternate medications.",
  "AccordionHeader5": "Check if a 90-day supply costs less than a 30-day refill.",
  "AccordionHeader6": "Watch out for combination medications.",
  "AccordionAnswer1": "Look up: oNeedyMeds Drug Discount Card (DDC) – Save up to 80% at participating pharmacies nationwide. o Patient Assistance Programs (PAPs) – Offered by drug manufacturers to provide free or low-cost medications to eligible patients. o Coupons & Rebates – May lower your out-of-pocket cost at the pharmacy. Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) Pricing – See what pharmacies offer transparent, discounted cash prices.",
  "AccordionAnswer2": "Even with the NeedyMeds Drug Discount Card, different pharmacies may offer different prices. Use our free tool to compare prices before you fill your prescription.",
  "AccordionAnswer3": "Generics have the same active ingredients and work the same way as brand-name drugs—often at a fraction of the cost.",
  "AccordionAnswer4": "Sometimes there’s a different drug that treats the same condition but costs less. Your doctor or pharmacist can help you compare options.",
  "AccordionAnswer5": "Many insurance plans and pharmacies offer lower per-dose prices when you fill a 90-day supply.",
  "AccordionAnswer6": "A single pill that combines two drugs may be more expensive than buying each  medication separately. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if taking the two components  individually could save you money.",
