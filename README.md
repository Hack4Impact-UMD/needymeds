NeedyMeds is a national nonprofit that has been working for over 27 years to make healthcare more affordable by providing information and tools to help people save on prescription medications. One of its offerings is the Drug Discount Card (DDC), which offers savings of up to 80% on prescription and over-the-counter medications (when prescribed), and is accepted at over 65,000 pharmacies nationwide. The DDC is open to anyone, regardless of income, residency, age, or insurance status.

We're building a cross-platform mobile application that allows users to digitally store and use their DDC, look up drug prices, compare costs across local pharmacies, and find educational resources - all in one accessible interface. Our goal is to make NeedyMeds’ offerings more accessible and convenient for users who rely primarily on mobile devices.
